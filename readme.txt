= What does "Delete Post Revisions" do?  =

The WordPress revisions system stores a record of each saved draft or published update. This can gather up a lot of overhead in the long run. Use this option to delete old post revisions.

If you enable this option and turn on the cron job then any new revisions will be automatically deleted on a daily basis.
